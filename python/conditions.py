# If/Else conditions are used to decide to do something based on something being true or false 

x = 10 
y = 50 

# Comparsion Operators (==, != , > , < , >= , <=) Used to compare values 

# Simple if 
if x > y: 
    print(f'{x} is greater than {y}')

# If/else 
#if x > y: 
#    print(f'{x} is greater than {y}')
#else: 
#    print(f'{y} is greater than {x}')
